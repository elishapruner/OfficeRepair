# CSI4124 Modelling and Simulation Project: OfficeRepair

SM Office Repair is a service designed by an existing office supply store to provide the very best customer support services for customers who have purchased their office equipment. Although, to date,  the operation  has been successful, the task of determining the staffing requirements and method of dispatching bas become a major corporate headache. 

In this analysis, SM Office Repair would like us to determine the optimal staffing levels throughout the work day that maximizes employee productivity and the number of contracts meeting time restrictions. In this analysis, customer satisfaction is the percentage of service calls that are completed within the contract timeline. Currently, customers are deemed satisfied when the percentage of service calls completed within the contract is at least 85%. SM Office Repair would also like to investigate the strategies to increase the number of service calls completed within the contract timeline to 95%.

In summary, the key problems of this simulation are: 1) hire an optimal amount of employees while still meeting the prescribed satisfaction level,and 2) Explore staffing options to be able to respond to the desired 95% of calls within the contract timeline.
